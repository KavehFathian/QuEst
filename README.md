# QuEst
This is a C++ implementation of the QuEst algorithm for camera relative pose estimation. A Matlab implementation is available [here](https://sites.google.com/view/kavehfathian/code/quest-5-point).

See the paper "[QuEst: a quaternion-based approach for camera motion estimation from minimal feature points](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8253803)" for more details.
